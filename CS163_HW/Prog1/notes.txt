Notes for myself:

- May need to overhaul my entire ADT. Maybe split the operations into two classes rather than one?
one to hand the list better (handles the linear linked list), the other to handle my structs (copying name, amenity, etc.)

- Delete member function will need to deallocate similar to the deconstructor.

- Maybe clean up the main function by separating operations into functions.

- tidy the menu.
