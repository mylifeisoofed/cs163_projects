# Welcome to My Programming Projects!
Here are all of the programming projects that I have done during CS163 at Portland State University, each exploring and focusing on different data structures and concepts. Below is an overview of each program:

## Program #1: Dog Park Explorer
It features a list of dog parks along with details about their amenities, features, and ratings. Implemented using a linear linked list, it offers a Yelp-like experience tailored specifically for dog parks.

## Program #2: Reading List Manager
This program allows users to list books they want to read. Implemented using a circular linked list as a queue and a stack.

## Program #3: Pet Information Database
Users can input details such as the animal's name, breed, size, and more. Implemented using a hashtable/hashmap with a collision resolution technique, this program ensures quick and efficient retrieval of pet information.

## Program #4: Pet Database with Binary Search Tree
Similar to Program #3, this program maintains pet information but uses a Binary Search Tree for implementation.

## Program #5: Graph Data Entry
This program allows users to interactively add and manage data within a graph data structure implemented as an adjacency list. The program also demonstrates a working Depth First Search and Breadth First Search algorithm.
