# Welcome to My Programming Projects!
This repository showcases a series of my programming projects that I have done during CS163 at Portland State University, each exploring and focusing on different data structures and concepts. Below is an overview of each program:

## Program #1: Dog Park Explorer
Explore dog parks with this program! It features a list of dog parks along with details about their amenities, features, and ratings. Implemented using a linear linked list, it offers a Yelp-like experience tailored specifically for dog parks.

## Program #2: Reading List Manager
Manage your reading list efficiently! This program allows users to list books they want to read. Implemented using a circular linked list as a queue and a stack, it provides a versatile solution for organizing reading preferences.

## Program #3: Pet Information Database
Store and manage information about pets of various kinds! Users can input details such as the animal's name, breed, size, and more. Implemented using a hashtable/hashmap, this program ensures quick and efficient retrieval of pet information.

## Program #4: Pet Database with Binary Search Tree
Similar to Program #3, this program maintains pet information but uses a Binary Search Tree for implementation. Explore the advantages of a different data structure for managing and searching through pet data.

## Program #5: Graph Data Entry
Enter and insert data into a graph using an adjacency list! This program allows users to interactively add and manage data within a graph structure, offering insights into the world of graph theory and adjacency lists.
